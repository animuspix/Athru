Creit goes to http://experilous.com/1/blog/post/procedural-planet-generation#elevation for inspiring me to
directly model elevation from plate tectonics; I should also probably thank the AIE and Wikipedia for 
explaining the Sobel operator to me, and various parts of the internet for convincing me that voronoi 
diagrams are MUCH simpler than they look :)

Besides any osmosis I got from research, this tool is 100% mine and doesn't rely on any third-party 
software at all outside the C# [System], [System.Collections.Generic], and [System.Drawing] libraries.
