Note:
Unions + structs/classes are too complicated to easily log members,
and it's impossible to easily log the names of enum values without
lots of boilerplate code. This has resulted in the following:

- Athru will only ever log the address + type-id of unions and
  avoid describing their members

- Athru will only ever log the address + type-id of structs/classes
  and avoid describing their members

- Athru will not attempt to log enums; any enum values that you want
  to log should be cast into an arithmetic type beforehand, and enum
  names must be stringified before being passed to the logger

Thank you for reading :)
